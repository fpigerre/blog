title: La Maison du BitCoin &middot A French Adventure...
---

Last week, while visiting Paris, the bustling capital of France, I popped into "La Maison du BitCoin", one of France's first, certified, commercial BitCoin exchanges[^1].
La Maison du BitCoin, situated in the third "arrondissement" of Paris[^2], was established early this year, and is now visited by many curious Parisians and travellers, eager to delve into the exciting, new world of crypto-currency.
Although it was setup to "promote the emergence and development of ambitious projects" that utilise the BitCoin protocol, La Maison du BitCoin also offers Parisians a central platform for buying BitCoin in cash.

- *May I have a BitCoin please?*

My journey commenced early in the morning with a short metro ride from my apartment, conveniently located in the nearby fourth arrondissement, under a number of busy streets, towards a quite conspicuous storefront, plastered with a large silver BitCoin logo...

A few days earlier, I had visited the store's website, and was delighted to find that La Maison du BitCoin not only offered smartphone friendly services and free WiFi, but also sold BitCoin in the form of paper wallets[^3], in case, when buying BitCoin, a customer forgot to bring their BitCoin wallet or didn't charge their smartphone.
As I made my way across the main room, passing a large white cube that contained an embedded screen, I was greeted in a very friendly manner by a staff member, who explained the way in which BitCoin worked and where I could spend BitCoin.
As this was the first time i'd ever visited a "bricks and mortar" BitCoin store, I was quite surprised at the resemblance of the store to an office that a technology-based startup company might use. I had expected a shop resembling a bank, but instead visited a laid-back office in which tech-gurus in their 20s chatted in English and drank coffee.

As we were talking, the staff member asked if i'd like to buy any BitCoin using the large white cube i'd passed earlier, which happened, in-fact, to be a BitCoin ATM.

On the screen flashed the current BitCoin to Euro exchange rate. I was quite tempted to buy a small amount, to test the ATM's user-friendly experience, however, the price was about 51 Euros (USD $69) higher than the exchange rate i'd checked about an hour ago online[^4] (this price may have included a 10% commission that La Maison du BitCoin charges for purchases), so I contented myself with a brochure and walked on my way.
It was interesting to note however, that in order to buy BitCoin from La Maison du BitCoin, a valid identification document is required, so as to comply with the ACPR's (Autorité de Contrôle Prudentiel et de Résolution)[^5] anti-fraud and money laundering policies.
Overall, the experience was quite pleasant. I'm happy to know that businesses dedicated to promoting BitCoin as a real-world currency are being set-up, and that BitCoin is gradually becoming a more convenient and accessible currency!
